# Personal Website

Welcome to Personal Website.  The aim of this project
is to create a personal website.

## UX

As a user, I would expect any external websites (e.g. British Computer Society) to open in a new tab, without leaving the web page.

As a user, I would have a screentip, when I hover onto the links (e.g. British Computer Society).
