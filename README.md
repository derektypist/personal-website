# Personal Website

Welcome to Personal Website.  The aim of this project
is to create a personal website in terms of computing and holidays.

## UX

As a user, I would expect any external websites (e.g. British Computer Society) to open in a new tab, without leaving the web page.

As a user, I would have a screentip, when I hover onto the links (e.g. British Computer Society).

As a user, I expect the links to change colour when I hover over the links (e.g. British Computer Society).

As a user, I expect an image or alternate text.

As a user, I expect a title and description below that image or alternate text.

As a user, I expect the navigation bar on every page.

As a user, when I hover over the navigation links (e.g. Computing), I expect to change background colour.

### Information Architecture

The personal website consists of Computing and Holidays.

In the Computing Page has computing groups (e.g. British Computer Society), office skills and programming.

The Holidays Page has an image or alternate text.  Below that image or alternate text, there is a title (e.g. Paris)
and description (e.g. Eiffel Tower in September 2015).

## Features

Links to external web sites.  When the link is clicked, the external website is on another tab.

In future, I would have additional links (e.g. Meetups).

## Testing

Ensure all the user stories have been met.

## Technologies

This project uses HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4.5.0.  The holidays page uses the card components.

Additional technologies include Font Awesome 5.14.0 and Google Fonts (e.g. Roboto).
