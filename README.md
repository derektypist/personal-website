# Personal Website

Welcome to Personal Website.  The aim of this project
is to create a personal website in terms of computing and holidays.

## UX

As a user, I would expect any external websites (e.g. British Computer Society) to open in a new tab, without leaving the web page.

As a user, I would have a screentip, when I hover onto the links (e.g. British Computer Society).

As a user, I expect the links to change colour when I hover over the links (e.g. British Computer Society).

## Features

Links to external web sites.  When the link is clicked, the external website is on another tab.

In future, I would have additional links (e.g. Meetups).
